Kitematic
Kitematic, the Docker GUI, runs on Mac OS X and Windows operating systems. 
Beginning with the 1.8 Docker release, you use the Docker Toolbox to install Kitematic. 
See the Mac OS X installation guide or the Windows installation guide for details on installing with Docker Toolbox.
For information about using Kitematic, take a look at the User Guide.

Install Docker Machine
On OS X and Windows, Machine is installed along with other Docker products when you install the Docker Toolbox. 
For details on installing Docker Toolbox, see the Mac OS X installation instructions or Windows installation instructions.
If you only want Docker Machine, you can install the Machine binaries (the latest versions of which are located at https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/ ) directly by following the instructions in the next section.

Install Docker Compose
You can run Compose on OS X and 64-bit Linux. It is currently not supported on the Windows operating system. 
To install Compose, you’ll need to install Docker first.

Install and Create a Docker Swarm
You use Docker Swarm to host and schedule a cluster of Docker containers. 
This section introduces you to Docker Swarm by teaching you how to create a swarm on your local machine using Docker Machine and VirtualBox.
