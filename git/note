1. Info
<1>git download
https://git-scm.com/

<2>git large file storage (LFS)
https://git-lfs.github.com/

- Download and install the Git command line extension. You only have to set up Git LFS once. 
git lfs install

- Select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your .gitattributes). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.
git lfs track "*.psd"

Make sure .gitattributes is tracked
git add .gitattributes

- There is no step three. Just commit and push to GitHub as you normally would.
git add file.psd
git commit -m "Add design file"
git push origin master
